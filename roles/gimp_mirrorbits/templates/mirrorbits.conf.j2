## This should, more or less, match the frequency where the local repo

## Maximum number of concurrent mirror synchronization to do (rsync/ftp)
# ConcurrentSync: 5

## Interval in minutes between mirror scan
# ScanInterval: 30

## Interval in minutes between mirrors HTTP health checks
# CheckInterval: 1

## Allow a mirror to issue an HTTP redirect.
## Setting this to true will disable the mirror if a redirect is detected.
DisallowRedirects: false

## Disable a mirror if an active file is missing (HTTP 404)
DisableOnMissingFile: true

## Adjust the weight/range of the geographic distribution
# WeightDistributionRange: 1.5

## Maximum number of alternative links to return in the HTTP header
# MaxLinkHeaders: 10

## Automatically fix timezone offsets.
## Enable this if one or more mirrors are always excluded because their
## last-modification-time mismatch. This option will try to guess the
## offset and adjust the mod time accordingly.
## Affected mirrors will need to be rescanned after enabling this feature.
FixTimezoneOffsets: true

## List of mirrors to use as fallback which will be used in case mirrorbits
## is unable to answer a request because the database is unreachable.
## Note: Mirrorbits will redirect to one of these mirrors based on the user
## location but won't be able to know if the mirror has the requested file.
## Therefore only put your most reliable and up-to-date mirrors here.
